# Monopoly
**Monopoly** is a multi-player economics-themed board game. In the game, players roll two dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. <br>
The game is written in Java for the mini-project of the **Advanced Programming Course** (*Spring 22*)<br><br>
